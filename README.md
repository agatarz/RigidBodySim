# RigidBodySim
Application of the dynamics of a rigid body in construction with the use of object-oriented programming in Python using Pymunk and Pyglet.
### General info
Simulation of the destruction of the bridge due to seismic vibrations and the scattering of the arch due to the subsidence of the support. 
Additionally, tests were carried out on simple physical phenomena:
- free fall, 
- box on inclined plane,
- ball on inclined plane

The simulations were carried out to present the problem of a rigid body in construction.
### Technologies
- Python 3.6
